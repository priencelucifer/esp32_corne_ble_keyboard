## Getting Started üöÄ

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Hardware**:
  - ESP32 development board
  - 18650 Lithium-ion Battery (2200mAh)
  - TP4056 Charging Module
  - Otemu Blue switches
  - Materials for handwiring (wires, solder, etc.)
  - 3D printed parts (case and top plate)

- **Software**:
  - [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) or [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)
